Personal Retro app
This app has been created in order to track personal development for each ANDI that signs up.
The idea came about after having watched Frances Maxwells video chat about her battle with Imposter Syndrome, and how she combatted that - she utilised a spreadsheet that detailed how she contributed to the team, what went well, what didn't go so well, and how she improved on that. This helped her to gain perspective on her abilities.
The basic idea is that this is a one-stop-shop for creating weekly work retros that detail how you felt that specific work sprint went. e.g. what you accomplished, what you struggled with etc.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:
**npm run dev**

**or**

yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
